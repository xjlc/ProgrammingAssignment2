# programming assignment 2 of Coursera course rprog-004
# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. 


# makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
# First of a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix. See also cacheSolve
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

# cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve retrieves the inverse from the cache.

# Second of a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix. See also makeCacheMatrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
